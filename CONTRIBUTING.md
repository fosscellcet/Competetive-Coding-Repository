## Contributors

We appreciate any contribution, from fixing a grammatical error in a comment to implementing complex algorithms.
Please read this section if you are contributing your work.

We want your code to be easily understood by others, so make sure:
1. You comment your code, with the working of the algorithm
2. Link any reference that helped you with the code, for example, a wikipedia page.
3. Help your reader by using descriptive names that can help you remove redundant comments.
    - Avoid single letter variable names, unless their scope is only a few lines.
    - Avoid acronyms.
3. Avoid taking user inputs. Hardcode a value instead. This is to avoid confusion while running the program.  
For example, avoid
```python
number = int(input()) # Don't do this.
```
instead, do:
```python
number = 10
```
If you can't avoid user input, make sure that the user will have a clear idea of what to give as the input, and does not face a blank prompt.  
5. Most importantly, make sure your code works, and do provide an example that shows its working.
